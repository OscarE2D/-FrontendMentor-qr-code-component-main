## Overview

This challenge consisted of building a simple and responsive QR code card using only HTML and CSS. I followed a **mobile-first** approach and took this as an opportunity to dive deeper into semantic HTML, responsive design techniques, and modern CSS features.

It also marked an important milestone for me: I used **Git and GitHub** for version control in a real project for the first time.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned

While working on this challenge, I faced several difficulties that turned into valuable learning experiences. One of the most interesting parts was diving deeper into the properties of the `<img>` tag:

```html
<img
  src="./assets/image-qr-code.png"
  alt="QR code image"
  height="300px"
  width="300px"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

Before, I only used `src` and `alt`, but this time I learned how other properties like `referrerpolicy` and `crossorigin` help protect information by preventing sensitive data from being sent in headers. I also discovered `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`, which improve overall performance by allowing images to load more efficiently without blocking the page flow. Until now, I wasnâ€™t very clear on how they worked, but I really enjoyed learning about their true purpose.

In terms of responsive design, I discovered how powerful `clamp()` can be. For example, I used `clamp(1rem, 1vw + 0.5rem, 1.375rem)` for font sizes and it worked like magic, eliminating the need for media queries and providing a more natural flow across different screen sizes.

I also made use of CSS custom properties (variables), which greatly help in keeping the code organized and make it easier to change certain values without having to search line by line. For the first time, I also wrote my own CSS reset, which was an enriching experience that helped me truly understand what each line does and how it affects the entire document.

Lastly, I want to highlight something very important: working with Git and GitHub. This was my first time uploading a complete project using version control, which was a personal challenge I had been meaning to tackle. Even though it wasnâ€™t too complicated, it was essential to understand each command and its purpose in order to keep everything running smoothly.

### Continued development

After completing the challenge, I was left with a few important topics that I definitely need to explore further.

First of all, and to keep some order, I believe itâ€™s essential to learn more about the properties of HTML tags and their main functions. Gaining a deeper understanding would help me improve both the performance and security of my pagesâ€”two aspects I hadn't paid much attention to before.

Secondly, Iâ€™d like to dive deeper into **CSS Grid**. While I managed to use it for layout purposes, I know it has much more potential. Mastering it would allow me to build more fluid structures and enhance the responsive design of my pages without relying so heavily on simpler solutions.

Lastly, another area Iâ€™m curious about is CSS functions. Iâ€™d like to identify how many there are, what they do, and how to make the most out of them. Sometimes we use them without really understanding their full potential, and I think dedicating time to this could really make a difference in future projects.

Considering the level of this challenge, these are the key questions and areas of curiosity Iâ€™m taking with me. They represent valuable opportunities to continue growing and improving as a developer.
